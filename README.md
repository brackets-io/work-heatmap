Work Heatmap - A Brackets Extension
-------------------

This extension displays visual dots/markers/bookmarks next to lines you've recently
edited. They appear as a dot next to the line number, and a bar in the scrollbar
track. It's handy for navigating and not losing your place in long files.

### User Preferences
If you want to hide the circle heatmap markers to the left of the line number, add this to your brackets.json user preferences file:
"work-heatmap.gutterEnabled": false

I'm a relatively new coder so bug reports and suggestions are welcome!
