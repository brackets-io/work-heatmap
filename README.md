Work Heatmap - A Brackets Extension
-------------------

This extension displays visual dots/markers/bookmarks next to lines you've recently
edited. They appear as a dot next to the line number, and a bar in the scrollbar
track. It's handy for navigating and not losing your place in long files.

I'm a relatively new coder so bug reports and suggestions are welcome!
